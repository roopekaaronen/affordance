# Affordance

This repository contains R code and CSV-files for the data analysis of my research article "Cultural Evolution of Sustainable Behaviours: Pro-Environmental Tipping Points in an Agent-Based Model".

The related agent-based model is available at COMSES: https://www.comses.net/codebase-release/9f2a58d5-fcb2-49f6-a75e-20577a94ec34/

You will also find the ABM's ODD protocol at the above link.

The file Analysis.R contains R code for data analysis. The .csv files in this repository are NetLogo output. The R code downloads many of these CSV-documents directly from GitHub, but due to size limits some of them had to be compressed (and thus require downloading).
